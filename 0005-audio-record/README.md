# Python Audio Recording Class

Here's a class using PyAudio that can start and stop audio recordings from an audio device:

```python
import pyaudio
import wave
import threading
import time
import os

class AudioRecorder:
    def __init__(self, filename="recording.wav", channels=1, rate=44100, chunk=1024, format=pyaudio.paInt16):
        """
        Initialize the audio recorder with configurable parameters
        
        Args:
            filename (str): Output filename for the recording
            channels (int): Number of audio channels (1=mono, 2=stereo)
            rate (int): Sample rate in Hz
            chunk (int): Number of frames per buffer
            format: Audio format (from pyaudio constants)
        """
        self.filename = filename
        self.channels = channels
        self.rate = rate
        self.chunk = chunk
        self.format = format
        self.p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
        self.frames = []
        self.is_recording = False
        self.recording_thread = None
    
    def start_recording(self):
        """Start audio recording in a separate thread"""
        if self.is_recording:
            print("Already recording!")
            return
            
        self.is_recording = True
        self.frames = []
        self.recording_thread = threading.Thread(target=self._record)
        self.recording_thread.start()
        print("Recording started...")
    
    def stop_recording(self):
        """Stop the recording and save to file"""
        if not self.is_recording:
            print("Not currently recording!")
            return
            
        self.is_recording = False
        if self.recording_thread:
            self.recording_thread.join()
        
        self._save_recording()
        print(f"Recording stopped and saved to {self.filename}")
    
    def _record(self):
        """Internal method that handles the recording process"""
        stream = self.p.open(
            format=self.format,
            channels=self.channels,
            rate=self.rate,
            input=True,
            frames_per_buffer=self.chunk
        )
        
        while self.is_recording:
            data = stream.read(self.chunk)
            self.frames.append(data)
        
        stream.stop_stream()
        stream.close()
    
    def _save_recording(self):
        """Save the recorded frames to a WAV file"""
        if not self.frames:
            print("No audio data to save")
            return
            
        wf = wave.open(self.filename, 'wb')
        wf.setnchannels(self.channels)
        wf.setsampwidth(self.p.get_sample_size(self.format))
        wf.setframerate(self.rate)
        wf.writeframes(b''.join(self.frames))
        wf.close()
    
    def __del__(self):
        """Clean up PyAudio when the object is destroyed"""
        self.p.terminate()
```

## Example Usage:

```python
# Example of how to use the AudioRecorder class
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create recorder instance
    recorder = AudioRecorder(filename="my_recording.wav")
    
    # Start recording
    recorder.start_recording()
    
    # Record for 5 seconds
    print("Recording for 5 seconds...")
    time.sleep(5)
    
    # Stop recording
    recorder.stop_recording()
    
    print("Done! Check the output file.")
```

## Key Features:
- Thread-based recording so it doesn't block your main program
- Configurable audio parameters (sample rate, channels, etc.)
- Simple start/stop interface
- Automatic cleanup of resources

## Requirements:
- PyAudio (`pip install pyaudio`)
- For Windows users, you might need to install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this code in more detail?


Why need to use wave package?

# Why the `wave` Package is Used in Audio Recording

The `wave` package is essential in the audio recording class for several important reasons:

## Primary Functions of the `wave` Package:

1. **WAV File Format Handling**:
   - The `wave` module provides a standardized interface for reading and writing WAV (Waveform Audio File Format) files
   - WAV is an uncompressed audio format that preserves the original audio quality

2. **Audio Data Storage**:
   - PyAudio itself only handles the streaming and capturing of raw audio data from devices
   - It doesn't provide functionality to save this data in a usable audio file format
   - The `wave` module bridges this gap by converting the raw audio frames into a properly formatted WAV file

3. **Audio Metadata Management**:
   - The `wave` module allows setting critical audio parameters in the file header:
     - `setnchannels()`: Defines if the audio is mono (1) or stereo (2)
     - `setsampwidth()`: Sets the sample width in bytes (audio resolution)
     - `setframerate()`: Sets the sample rate (e.g., 44100 Hz)
   - These parameters are essential for any software that will later play the audio file

## In the Code Context:

```python
def _save_recording(self):
    wf = wave.open(self.filename, 'wb')  # Opens a WAV file for writing in binary mode
    wf.setnchannels(self.channels)       # Sets mono/stereo
    wf.setsampwidth(self.p.get_sample_size(self.format))  # Sets bit depth
    wf.setframerate(self.rate)           # Sets sample rate
    wf.writeframes(b''.join(self.frames))  # Writes all audio data at once
    wf.close()                           # Finalizes the file
```

Without the `wave` module, you would have:
- Raw binary audio data with no standardized container format
- No way for media players to interpret the audio parameters
- No easy way to share or use the recordings in other applications

If you wanted to use a different audio format (like MP3 or FLAC), you would need to use a different library instead of `wave`, such as `pydub` or specialized encoders for those formats.


What is chunk from the AudioRecorder class?

# Understanding the `chunk` Parameter in AudioRecorder


The `chunk` parameter in the AudioRecorder class is a fundamental concept in digital audio processing that refers to the number of audio frames processed at one time. Let me explain its significance:

## What is a Chunk?

A chunk (also called a "buffer size" or "frame count") represents:

- **The number of audio frames** that PyAudio will request from the audio device in a single read operation
- **A frame** contains one sample for each channel (so for mono audio, 1 frame = 1 sample)
- The size in bytes of each read operation will be: `chunk × channels × sample_width`

## In the AudioRecorder Class:

```python
def __init__(self, filename="recording.wav", channels=1, rate=44100, chunk=1024, format=pyaudio.paInt16):
    # chunk=1024 is the default value
```

And it's used when reading from the audio stream:

```python
def _record(self):
    # ...
    while self.is_recording:
        data = stream.read(self.chunk)  # Read chunk frames at a time
        self.frames.append(data)
    # ...
```

## Why Chunk Size Matters:

1. **Latency vs. Stability Trade-off**:
   - **Smaller chunks** (e.g., 256, 512): Lower latency but more CPU overhead and potential for buffer underruns
   - **Larger chunks** (e.g., 2048, 4096): More stable processing but higher latency

2. **Real-time Processing Considerations**:
   - The chunk size directly affects how frequently your code processes audio
   - For real-time applications, this impacts responsiveness

3. **System Resource Usage**:
   - Each read operation has overhead
   - Too small chunks = many operations = higher CPU usage
   - Too large chunks = more memory usage per operation

## Typical Values:

- **1024** (default in your class): A good balance for most recording applications
- **512**: Often used when lower latency is needed
- **2048 or 4096**: Used when processing stability is more important than latency

The optimal chunk size depends on:
- Your computer's performance
- The audio processing you're doing
- The required responsiveness of your application
- The sample rate (higher rates may need larger chunks)

You can adjust this parameter based on your specific needs when creating an instance of the AudioRecorder class.


How many seconds in 1024 chunk size? How to calculate number of seconds from chunk size?

# Calculating Time Duration from Chunk Size

The time duration represented by a chunk depends on the sample rate. Here's how to calculate the number of seconds in a chunk:

## Formula:

```
Time (seconds) = Chunk Size (frames) / Sample Rate (frames per second)
```

## For the Default Values in AudioRecorder:

With the default parameters in the AudioRecorder class:
- Chunk size: 1024 frames
- Sample rate: 44100 Hz (frames per second)

```
Time = 1024 / 44100 = 0.0232... seconds
```

So a chunk size of 1024 at 44.1 kHz represents approximately **23.2 milliseconds** of audio.

## Examples with Different Sample Rates:

| Chunk Size | Sample Rate | Time Duration |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1024       | 44100 Hz    | 23.2 ms       |
| 1024       | 48000 Hz    | 21.3 ms       |
| 1024       | 22050 Hz    | 46.4 ms       |
| 1024       | 16000 Hz    | 64.0 ms       |
| 2048       | 44100 Hz    | 46.4 ms       |
| 512        | 44100 Hz    | 11.6 ms       |

## Code to Calculate Chunk Duration:

```python
def calculate_chunk_duration(chunk_size, sample_rate):
    """
    Calculate the duration of an audio chunk in seconds
    
    Args:
        chunk_size (int): Number of frames in the chunk
        sample_rate (int): Sample rate in Hz
        
    Returns:
        float: Duration in seconds
    """
    return chunk_size / sample_rate
```

## Calculating Total Recording Time:

If you want to know the total duration of a recording:

```python
total_frames = len(self.frames) * self.chunk  # Total number of frames
duration_seconds = total_frames / self.rate   # Duration in seconds
```

Or you could add this as a method to your AudioRecorder class:

```python
def get_recording_duration(self):
    """Return the current recording duration in seconds"""
    if not self.frames:
        return 0
    return len(self.frames) * self.chunk / self.rate
```

This relationship between chunk size and time is important when designing audio applications with specific latency requirements or when you need to process audio in specific time intervals.
